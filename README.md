# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. This project implements the use of flexbox to horizontally arrange elements. It is a SPA which uses a navbar block to bring you to different parts of the page using # elements and section id tags. There are hover effects used to create some transitiory effects when hovering over links i.e navbar links, social links, and the form button. Each block of CSS styles has been seperated into the "blocks" folder accordingly and all class names conform to BEM class structure and naming.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Adding functiuonality to the form for example, taking the user input and using it to aggregate data on the backend.

We should also fancy up the fonts and maybe add some keyframe elements to stylize and "wow" the user a little more.

We could also leave the navbar in the "fixed" position so that when scrolling, it still appears on the webpage at any point.
